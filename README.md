Ppnc
====

Ppnc is a collection of python scripts that have been used to extract pp fields 
to cf-netCDF for submission to the CCMI archive.

The code makes extensive use of Iris: 

- https://github.com/SciTools/iris

Requirements
------------

The following python modules are used:

- iris
- numpy

F2PY is used to create the pressureconv modules

- http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/

```
f2py -c -m pressureconv pressureconv.f90
```

Support
-------

These scripts are provided in the hope that someone will find them useful. Due 
to time restrictions, support for using these scripts is not available.

Example Usage
-------------

For usage run:

```python ppnc.py --help```

or

```python ppnc_cella.py --help```

Edit some of the files under config to fit your particular use case.

- config/global_attrs.py # defines some of the metadata that is written
- config/req_data.py # defines your stashes, conversion factors and units
- config/tweakables.py # defines your fillvalue and pressure levels

An example invocation of ppnc is as follows:

    python ppnc.py -j $JID # Model JobID \
                   -t "203001-203912" # Temporal Subset \
                   -p /path/to/output/files \ 
                   -s $STASH # STASH to restrict to \ 
                   --pgrid THETA # Pressure Grid \
                   -f /path/to/pp/files/*.pp # pp files to use

An example invocation of ppnc_cella is as follows:

    python ppnc_cella.py -j $JID # Model JobID \
                         -a /path/to/model/orography # often called qrparm.orog \
                         -l /path/to/model/land-fraction_file # often called qrparm.fracmask \
                         -p /path/to/output/files \ 
                         -f /path/to/pp/files/${JID}a.pm${C}${N}${mon}.pp # Optional single pp-file to use if calculating grid-cell volume

Note that for ppnc_cella.py, a .pp file containing a single time-point should 
be used if the gridcell volume is required. This file should contain air
potential temperature (theta: m01s00i004). This script writes out areacella, orog, sftlf,
and "volcella" (if -f is specified) files.

The submit_scripts folder contains some example bash scripts to create and 
submit jobs on a system running LSF.
